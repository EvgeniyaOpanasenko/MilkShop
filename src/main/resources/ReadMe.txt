Current project is a sort of shop, which can be easily used both for goods and services purpose.
The main idea is to get flexible structure.
Kind of a practice to use as much design patterns as possible

Used technologies :
    backend:
        spring:
         boot,
         data,
         security

    design patterns:
         strategy => to achieve architecture for both goods and services purpose.
                     Only need to extend proper interface
         observer => to notify admin about new order. Send main and sms
                  => TODO notify user about order detais
